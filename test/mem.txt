VOX POPULI

In these democratic days, any investigation into the trustworthiness and
peculiarities of popular judgments is of interest. The material about to be
discussed refers to a small matter, but is much to the point.

A weight-judging competition was carried on at the annual show of the West of
England Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition recently held at Plymouth (England).
A fat ox having been selected, competitors bought stamped and numbered cards,
for 6d. each, on which to inscribe their respective names, addresses, and
estimates of what the ox would weigh after it had been slaughtered and
"dressed." Those who guessed most successfully received prizes. About 800
tickets were issued, which were kindly lent me for examination after they
had fulfilled their immediate purpose. These afforded excellent material.
The judgements were [unbiassed] by passion and uninfluenced by oratory and
the like. The sixpenny fee deterred practical joking, and the hope of a
prize and the joy of competition prompted each competitor to do his best.
The competitors included butchers and farmers, some of whom were highly
expert in judging the weight of cattle; others were probably guided by such
information as they might pick up, and by their own fancies. The average
competitor was probably as well fitted for making a just estimate of the
dressed weight of the ox, as an average voter is of judging the merits of
most political issues on which he votes, and the variety among the voters to
judge justly was probably much the same in either case.

After weeding thirteen cards out of the collection, as being defective or
illegible, there remained 787 for discussion. I arrayed them in order of
magnitudes of the estimates, and converted the *cwt.*, *quarters*, and *lbs.*
in which they were made, into lbs., under which form they will be treated.

The dressed weight proved to be 1198 lbs.</small></p>

According to the democratic principle of "one vote one value," the middlemost
estimate expresses the *vox populi*, every other estimate being condemned as
too low or high by a majority of the voters (for fuller explanation see 
[One Vote, One Value](http://galton.org/essays/1900-1911/galton-1907-vote-value.pdf), 
NATURE, February 28, p. 414). Now the middlemost estimate is
1207 lb., and the weight of the dressed ox proved to be 1198 lb.; so the 
*vox populi* was in this case 9 lb., or 0.8 per cent. of the whole weight too
high. The distribution of the estimates about their middlemost value was of
the usual type, so far that they clustered closely in its neighbourhood and
became rapidly more sparse as the distance from it increased.

But they were not scattered symmetrically. One quarter of them deviated more
than 45 lb. above the middlemost (3.7 per cent.), and another quarter
deviated more than 29 lb. below it (2.4 per cent.), therefore the range of the
two middle quarters, that is, of the middlemost half, lay within those
limits. It would be an equal chance that the estimate written on any card
picked at random out of the collection lay within or without those limits. In
other words, the "probably error" of a single observation may be reckoned as
`1/2(45 + 29)`, or 37 lb. (3.1 per cent.). Taking this for the p.e. of the
normal curve that is best adapted for comparison with the observed values, the
results are obtained which appear in above table, and graphically in the
diagram<sup>1</sup>.

The abnormality of the distribution of the estimates now becomes manifest, and
is of this kind. The competitors may be imagined to have erred *normally* in
the first instance, and then to have magnified all errors that were positive.
The lower half of the "observed" curve agrees for a large part of its range
with a normal curve having the p.e. = 45, and the upper half with one having
its p.e. = 29. I have not sufficient knowledge of the mental methods followed
by those who judge weights to offer a useful opinion as to the cause of this
curious anomaly. It is partly a psychological question, in answering which the
various psychophysical investigations of Fechner and other would have to be
taken into account. Also the anomaly may be partly due to the use of a *small*
variety of different methods, or formulae, so that the estimates are not
homogeneous in that respect.

It appears then, in this particular instance, that the *vox populi* is correct
to within 1 per cent. of the real value, and that the individual estimates are
abnormally distributed in such a way that it is an equal chance whether one of
them, selected at random, falls within or without the limits of -3.7 per cent.
and +2.4 per cent. of their middlemost value.

This result is, I think, more creditable to the trustworthiness of a
democratic judgement than might have been expected.

The authorities of the more important cattle shows might do service to
statistics if they made a practice of preserving the sets of cards of this
description, that they may obtain on future occasions, and loaned them under
proper restrictions, as these have been, for statistical discussion. The fact
of the cards being numbered makes it possible to ascertain whether any given
set is complete.
