Ruby peg-markdown Extension
===========================

The peg-markdown extension wraps John MacFarlane's C implementation of
Markdown (see [peg-markdown][1]) in a Ruby extension.

BUGS
----

This extension currently leaks memory like a sieve. The underlying C
implementation assumes the process will end immediately after processing
and thus punts on memory management entirely. Use in any kind of long-running
environment is highly discouraged until this is corrected.
